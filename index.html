	<p><b>Norway</b> has two official names:
		<ul> 
			<li>Norge in Bokmål</li>
			<li>Noreg in Nynorsk.</li>
		</ul> 
			The English name Norway comes from the Old English word Norþweg mentioned in 880, meaning "northern way" or "way leading to the north", which is how the Anglo-Saxons referred to the coastline of Atlantic Norway[27][28] similar to scientific consensus about the origin of the Norwegian language name.
